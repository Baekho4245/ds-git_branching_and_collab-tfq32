Let's follow this workflow.

Person A:

1. Checkout a new branch called "readme" and edit the README.
2. Push your new branch to the repo on GitHub and make a pull request.

Person B:
1. Accept the pull request and then pull the changes (to the README) down to your local copy.
2. Checkout a new branch called "code_add" and create a new .py file.
3. Add a function to the .py file that will input a list of strings, remove the whitespace from each, and then return the string that is alphabetically first (use 'min()').
4. Push your new branch to the repo on GitHub and make a pull request.

Person A:
1. Accept the pull request and then pull the changes (the new .py file) down to your local copy.

Use VS Code to manage merge conflict?
Build a src folder with a __init__.py to make custom functions importable.
